# Hotbox Version 2.0
The goal of this project is to make running a witness for smoke.io more predictable and reliable.

If you have any ideas on how to make this better please let me know or submit a pull request.

[Read the wiki](https://github.com/jrswab/hotbox/wiki) for starting from scratch, updating, or moving from a non-Hotbox based witness.
